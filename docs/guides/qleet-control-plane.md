# Managed Threeport Control Plane

Qleet hosts managed [Threeport](https://threeport.io/) control planes for you
company to use.

While we're in private beta, you can reach out to our team to provision a new
Threeport control plane for you.  Email any contact you have at Qleet to get started,
or email us at [info@qleet.io](mailto:info@qleet.io).

> Coming soon: you will be able to provision your own Threeport control planes
> using qleetctl.

## Control Plane Config

1. Once you get the name for your Threeport control plane instance from us, you
can set it up for use with one command.

    ```bash
    qleetctl config current-control-plane --name=$controlPlaneName
    ```

## Next Steps

Now that you have a Threeport control plane to use, follow our [Add AWS Account
guide](add-aws-account.md) to connect your AWS account.
