# Qleet

Qleet is a managed [Threeport](https://threeport.io/) service.  It provides all
the functionality of open source Threeport plus the following:

* Managed Threeport Control Planes: Qleet users do not have to install, upgrade
  or manage Threeport control planes.  The Qleet service provides them for its
  users.
* Role Based Access Control (RBAC): Open source Threeport does not implement access
  control - all users are super-users.  Qleet users can apply RBAC rules to
  users on their account to provide appropriate access based on roles.
* 3rd Party Identity Provider Integration (Coming Soon): Qleet currently offers
  secure authentication to Qleet services and will soon offer integrations with
  3rd party services to authenticate users.
* Graphical User Interface (Coming Soon): Qleet currently offers command line
  access to the system with the `qleetctl` CLI tool.  Soon, we will release a
  portal so Qleet users can view and manage their resources with a GUI as well.

This site provides user documentation specific to the Qleet platform.  It
includes documentation for using the managed Threeport control planes.  If you
are using open source Threeport, see the [Threeport
Documentation](https://docs.threeport.io/).
